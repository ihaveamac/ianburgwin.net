		<h3>Nintendo 3DS Homebrew</h3>
		<p>I've done lots of things related to homebrew now, like testing and breaking things.</p>
		<h2>Tools</h2>
		<p>Here's yet another 3DS -> CIA Converter, for Python 2.x. It only requires ExHeader (Extended Header) XORpads to do a conversion, similar to another tool out there.</p>

		<p>I made some things when doing things with 3DS roms like extracting and rebuilding. Maybe someone will find these useful.</p>

		<p>I started working on a repository for *hax 2.7, which is going to support titles encrypted with a new kind of crypto starting with 9.6.0-24.</p>
		<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/ihaveamac/9.6-dbgen-xmls">9.6-dbgen-xmls</a></li></ul>
		<h2>Homebrew software</h2>
		<p>I created a downloader for game covers for GameTDB's 3DS section. The covers are used with mashers's Grid Launcher.</p>
		<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/ihaveamac/3DSFlow-downloader">3DSFlow-downloader</a></li></ul>
		<p>This is screenshot-merge. It simply takes screenshots taken with ninjhax 2.x or NTR CFW and merges the top and bottom screens into a single image, without using a computer.</p>
		<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/ihaveamac/screenshot-merge">screenshot-merge</a></li></ul>
		<p>This is mashers-gl-updater, the updater that is included with mashers's Grid Launcher. It was annoying and interesting with the workarounds I had to use; for example, this site needs to cache the latest version as opposed to the 3DS connecting to GitHub directly. There are more details in the repository if you are interested.</p>

		<!--<p>I was working on a file manager of sorts. At this point I should just rewrite it.</p>
