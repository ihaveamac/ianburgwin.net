		<h3>What is it I do with 3DS homebrew?</h3>
		<p>Sometimes I'd make videos trying out a new piece of homebrew and want to show it off.</p>
		<p>Other times (and most of the time, really) I just like to break things by using it improperly. Or try out something that's really broken.</p>
		<p>I have three 3DS systems, so I'm more willing to try more dangerous things, such as formatting a system through HANS (which I have done before!). <a href="resources/images/DS3DS-systems.jpeg">Here's a link to them, including DS!</a></p>

		<p>I occasionally do testing for homebrew as well. I've helped Rinnegatamante a few times running homebrew on ninjhax 2.5, as well as dumping and testing for CHMM2's theme shuffle support. I enjoy doing it so I keep going.</p>
		<p>I plan on getting a 2DS bundled with Mario Kart 7, because I will be able to try out emunand and various other things that require a kernel exploit.</p>
		<p>Here's one of my "completed" projects, and you've probably already heard of it already: the updater that is included with mashers's Grid Launcher. It was annoying and interesting with the workarounds I had to use; for example, this site needs to cache the latest version as opposed to the 3DS connecting to GitHub directly. There are more details in the repository.</p>

		<p>This is my second homebrew: screenshot-merge. It simply takes screenshots taken with ninjhax 2.5 or NTR CFW and merges the top and bottom screens into a single image, without using a computer.</p>
		<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/ihaveamac/screenshot-merge">GitHub (screenshot-merge)</a></li></ul>
		<p>I was working on a file manager of sorts. At this point I should just rewrite it.</p>

		<h3>What is it I do outside of homebrew?</h3>
		<p>Honestly, I've not been playing that many games ever since ironhax was released. I'm wanting to get Pok&eacute;mon Super Mystery Dungeon eventually.</p>
